This visualization will be a continuation of the tree map used in the qualitative assignment however, rather than displaying the names on the tree map only the count of times
a first name appears will be displayed. On click of each tree map tile the first name will be displayed along with a gallery of the portraits where the subjects have that first name. 

<h3>The Extinct </h3>

This circle packing diagram will have added filter ability so that user's are able to filter the first name's by the amount of times they appeared in the dataset. 
When a filter is selected only those first names appearing in the dataset that amount of times will be displayed on the screen.
